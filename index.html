            <h1>Help all the flood affected People of Sylhet & Sunamgonj</h1>
            <!-- <h1>of Sylhet & Sunamgonj</h1> -->
            <p>In the last few weeks, millions of people in the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have experienced heavy
                rains
                and flash floods, leaving them homeless and without possessions. With homes crushed, objects floating
                away
                and people missing, the country is at high alert. This is not the first time the northeastern region
                (Sylhet) of Bangladesh is experiencing these floods, which have occurred twice already in 2022 alone.
                Now,
                they have begun again, starting in May 2022 with heavy rains battering the area, rivers overflowing, and
                excess water sweeping through the region. Since 17th June, the situation has dramatically worsened and
                affected additional districts, increasing the magnitude and scale of damage. Around a quarter of the
                country
                is now flooded.</p>
