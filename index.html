            <h1>Help all the flood affected People</h1>
            <h1>of Sylhet & Sunamgonj</h1>
            <p class="set-allign">In the last few weeks, millions of people in the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have
                experienced heavy
                rains
                and flash floods, leaving them homeless and without possessions. With homes crushed, objects floating
                away
                and people missing, the country is at high alert. This is not the first time the northeastern region
                (Sylhet) of Bangladesh is experiencing these floods, which have occurred twice already in 2022 alone.

                    <h3>Food for a family</h3>
                    <p>Through food, we learn about cooking and nutrition, meal planning, money management, and smart
                        shopping. Food provides opportunities for families to learn about responsibility and chores and
                        about working and sharing time together. Clearly food plays a greater role than simply
                        nourishing our bodies.</p>

                    <p>Shelters provide secure accommodation for women and girls who are at risk of or have been
                        subjected to violence, although they contribute far more than just a safe place to stay.
                        Shelters provide essential aspects of protection, services and resources which enable women who
                        have experienced abuse.</p>

                    <h3>Educatio for a child</h3>
                <p>Education brings self-discipline, a sense of responsibility, team-work among children and prevents
                    them from feeling social insecurity. It helps in being self-confident and a good decision-maker.
                    Hence, every child must be educated so that they can lead a happy life.</p>

        <p>People in at least 100 villages are surviving without food and barely any clean water. Many people died for hungry. The Govt. of Bangladesh appointed army for giving relief to the people. But these are insufficient. They need to support from the whole country. Everybody should stands besides the flood affected people.</p>
